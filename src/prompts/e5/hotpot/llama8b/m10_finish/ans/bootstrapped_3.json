The original question was searched for relevant documents, which provided information about the mines. The passages from the search results were then analyzed to determine the precious metal that both mines dug for. The analysis revealed that both mines produced a significant amount of gold over their lifetimes. Further searches were conducted to confirm this information and to determine if gold is a precious metal commonly associated with both gold and copper mining. The results of these searches supported the conclusion that gold is the precious metal that both McIntyre Mines and the Kemess Mine dug for.",
