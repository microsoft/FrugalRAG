Big Four (British railway companies) The Big Four was a name used to describe the four largest railway companies in the United Kingdom in the period 1923\u201347. The name was coined by \\\"\\\"The Railway Magazine\\\"\\\" in its issue of February 1923: \\\"\\\"The Big Four of the New Railway Era\\\"\\\".

Passenger services were divided into 25 operating companies, which were let on a franchise basis for a set period, whilst goods services were sold off completely. Dozens of smaller engineering and maintenance companies were also created and sold off. British Rail's passenger services came to an end upon the franchising of ScotRail; the final train that the company operated was a Railfreight Distribution goods train in autumn 1997. The British Railways Board continued in existence as a corporation until early 2001, when it was replaced with the Strategic Rail Authority.

Under the Transport Act of 1962 , Harold Macmillan's Conservative government dissolved the British Transport Commission, and created the British Railways Board to take over its railway duties from 1 January 1963. The railway's huge deficit and the reputation earned during the Modernisation Plan fiasco for bad financial planning led the government to take firm action.
